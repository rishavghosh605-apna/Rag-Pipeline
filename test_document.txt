RAG Chat Assistant - Test Document

This is a sample document to test the RAG Chat Assistant application.

About RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
==========================================

RAG is a technique that combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. This approach has several advantages:

1. Accuracy: By grounding responses in actual documents, RAG reduces hallucinations and provides more accurate answers.

2. Specificity: RAG can provide detailed answers based on your specific documents rather than general knowledge.

3. Traceability: You can see exactly which parts of your documents were used to generate each answer.

How This Application Works
=========================

Step 1: Document Upload
- You upload PDF documents through the web interface
- The application extracts text from these PDFs

Step 2: Document Processing
- Text is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing
- Each chunk is converted into embeddings (numerical representations)
- Embeddings are stored in a vector database

Step 3: Question Answering
- When you ask a question, it's converted to an embedding
- The system finds the most relevant document chunks
- These chunks are sent to the AI model along with your question
- The AI generates an answer based on the retrieved information

Test Questions
=============

After uploading this document, try asking these questions:
- What is RAG?
- How does this application work?
- What are the advantages of using RAG?
- What happens during document processing?

Technical Details
================

This application uses:
- Streamlit for the web interface
- LangChain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- OpenAI's GPT models for generating answers
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- PyPDF for PDF processing
